Go through the report.pptx file for better understanding

during behavioural simulation

before starting of simulations
------------------------------
set the values as for
clock: force clock 
leading 1
trailing 0
period 20000

set time-center button: force  constant
set value 0
end time: 40000

hrs: force constant 
set value: some value in 24 hrs format
end time: 10000


minutes: force constant 
set value: some value in 24 hrs format - minutes
end time: 10000

notes: seconds cant be given any values

now start the simulations, and pause it 
---------------------------------------
set the values for 
center - force constant
set value : 1
end time: 40000

now start the simulations; you'll get the results
